- Reverse Proxies

    - A 'proxy server' is a server application or appliance that acts as an intermediary for
        requests from clients seeking resources from servers that provide those resources.

      For example, instead of connecting directly to a server that can fulfill a requested
        resource (such as a file or web page), the client directs the request to the proxy
        server, which evaluates the request and performs the required actions.

      This can be used to control the complexity of the request, and for things like load
        balancing, privacy, and security.


    - A 'forward proxy' (or 'proxy server') is an intermediary for its associated clients
        to contact any server.  It acts on behalf of the clients.


    - A 'reverse proxy' is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of 
        a client from one or more servers.  It is an intermediary for its associated servers
        to contact any client.  It acts on behalf of the servers.



- Uses of Reverse Proxies

    - Reverse proxies can hide the existence and characteristics of origin servers.

    - Application firewall features can protect against common web-based attacks like DDOS attacks.

    - In the case of secure websites, a web server may not perform TLS encryption itself, but 
        instead offload the task to a reverse proxy that may have TLS acceleration hardware.

    - Load balancing.

    - Caching static and dynamic content.

    - Optimize the content by compressing it to speed up load times.

    - Perform A/B testing and multivariate testing without changing code.

    - Addd basic HTTP authentication to a web server that doesn't have any authentication.
